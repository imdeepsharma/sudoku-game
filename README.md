# How to Play Sudoku

**The Goal:** Fill a 9×9 grid with numbers 1-9 so that each row, column, and 3×3 box contains every number exactly once.

## Basic Rules

1. **Rows** — Each horizontal line must have all numbers 1-9, with no repeats
2. **Columns** — Each vertical line must have all numbers 1-9, with no repeats
3. **3×3 Boxes** — The grid is divided into nine 3×3 boxes; each must contain 1-9 with no repeats

## Getting Started

1. **Look for obvious placements** — Find cells where only one number is possible based on the rules above
2. **Use elimination** — If a row already has 1, 2, and 3, you know those numbers can't go in the empty cells of that row
3. **Work systematically** — Focus on rows, columns, or boxes that are almost complete
4. **Fill in what you're sure about** — Start with easier cells before tackling harder logic

## Tips for Beginners

- **Pencil in possibilities** — Many puzzles let you note small candidate numbers in each cell to track options
- **Start with numbers that appear often** — Look for rows/columns/boxes with many given numbers already
- **Take your time** — Sudoku rewards patience; rushing leads to mistakes
- **No guessing needed** — Valid puzzles have a logical solution without random guessing

Once you get the hang of it, you'll start seeing patterns naturally. Good luck!
